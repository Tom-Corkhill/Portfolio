                            I am searching for my first job in website development. 
                            In 2019 I travelled and worked in Australia and came back to the UK eager to find work. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            When the Covid-19 lockdown struck I used that time to teach myself to code, and absolutely loved it. 
                            I learnt it through a range of different courses and online tutorials. 
                            Eight months later I have built a full website for a client and have created other personal projects. 
                            These can all be viewed over on the portfolio page.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I am now eager to find my first role in the industry and progress my skills further.
                            </p>
